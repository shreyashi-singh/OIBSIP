        <h2>Early Life</h2>
        <p>Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi was born on 2 October 1869 into a Gujarati Hindu Modh Bania family in Porbandar, a coastal town on the Kathiawar Peninsula and then part of the small princely state of Porbandar in the Kathiawar Agency of the British Raj. His father, Karamchand Uttamchand Gandhi, served as the dewan (chief minister) of Porbandar state.His family originated from the then village of Kutiana in what was then Junagadh State.On 2 October 1869, Putlibai gave birth to her last child, Mohandas, in a dark, windowless ground-floor room of the Gandhi family residence in Porbandar city.As a child, Gandhi was described by his sister Raliat as "restless as mercury, either playing or roaming about. One of his favourite pastimes was twisting dogs' ears.The Indian classics, especially the stories of Shravana and king Harishchandra, had a great impact on Gandhi in his childhood. In his autobiography, he states that they left an indelible impression on his mind. He writes: "It haunted me and I must have acted Harishchandra to myself times without number." Gandhi's early self-identification with truth and love as supreme values is traceable to these epic characters.The family's religious background was eclectic. Gandhi's father Karamchand was Hindu and his mother Putlibai was from a Pranami Vaishnava Hindu family.Gandhi's father was of Modh Baniya caste in the varna of Vaishya.His mother came from the medieval Krishna bhakti-based Pranami tradition, whose religious texts include the Bhagavad Gita, the Bhagavata Purana, and a collection of 14 texts with teachings that the tradition believes to include the essence of the Vedas, the Quran and the Bible.Gandhi was deeply influenced by his mother, an extremely pious lady who "would not think of taking her meals without her daily prayers... she would take the hardest vows and keep them without flinching. To keep two or three consecutive fasts was nothing to her.At age 9, Gandhi entered the local school in Rajkot, near his home. There, he studied the rudiments of arithmetic, history, the Gujarati language and geography.At the age of 11, he joined the High School in Rajkot, Alfred High School.He was an average student, won some prizes, but was a shy and tongue tied student, with no interest in games; his only companions were books and school lessons.In May 1883, the 13-year-old Mohandas was married to 14-year-old Kasturbai Gokuldas Kapadia in an arranged marriage, according to the custom of the region at that time.In the process, he lost a year at school but was later allowed to make up by accelerating his studies.His wedding was a joint event, where his brother and cousin were also married. Recalling the day of their marriage, he once said, "As we didn't know much about marriage, for us it meant only wearing new clothes, eating sweets and playing with relatives.In late 1885, Gandhi's father Karamchand died.Gandhi, then 16 years old, and his wife of age 17 had their first baby, who survived only a few days. The two deaths anguished Gandhi.The Gandhi couple had four more children, all sons: Harilal, born in 1888; Manilal, born in 1892; Ramdas, born in 1897; and Devdas, born in 1900.In November 1887, the 18-year-old Gandhi graduated from high school in Ahmedabad.In January 1888, he enrolled at Samaldas College in Bhavnagar State, then the sole degree-granting institution of higher education in the region. However, he dropped out, and returned to his family in Porbandar.</p>

Gandhi was a successful lawyer who gave up his practice to live a simpler, more peaceful life.many people admire Gandhi because of his simplistic and peaceful mindset. Wherever Gandhi went, people flocked to hear him speak, day or night.Mahatma Gandhi is leadership style is complex because he was not a typical leader. Gandhi was not authoritarian, but he was strong in a different way. There are many strengths in his unique leadership style.Mahatma Gandhi also had a heart for the people of India, and he shared that heart frequently in how he treated them. When he taught the people of India, he never spoke or wrote from a place of power and status, but with equality and compassion.Leaders in history have often put themselves and their own professional advancement over the best interests of the institution that they lead. They sacrifice the betterment of the people they lead for their own gain. Gandhi was not this way. He made an effort to truly understand the people he represented and spoke to his people from their own point of view. The people of India respected the way Gandhi viewed individual Indian people.One of the great qualities of a leader is the willingness to continue to learn. No one likes a leader with a big ego who comes across as a know-it-all. Gandhi was not this way at all.Mahatma Gandhi continuously studied scripture in the pursuit of higher spiritual understanding. He knew that he did not know everything, and despite his old age, he continued to learn for his entire life. Being a lifelong learner is a great character quality for a leader because it shows the people you lead that you are willing to learn and grow, rather than just dictate.</p>
